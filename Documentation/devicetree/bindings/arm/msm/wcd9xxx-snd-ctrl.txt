Qualcomm WCD9xxx SysFS Sound Gain Controller

This is a SysFS-based analogue of IOCTL sound register read/write operations
handler. It was implemented to simplify the intercommunication with sound codec
registers (so-called lines) and allow to control them via a simple sysfs entry.
Its main purpose is to replace a hacky FauxSound with an appropriate variant
that provides the same functionality.  This module allows to manipulate with
almost every register acquired by codec implementation with help of its generic
interface.

The Device Tree representation of WCD9xxx Sound Gain Controller should be:

Required properties:
- compatible:		"qcom,wcd9xxx-snd-ctrl".
- qcom,codec_name:	The name of an expected codec, which is expected to be
			controlled via the sysfs module. A codec with this name
			will be used as global immediately after registration.
- One of the optional properties below: otherwise, there is no sense in having
			Device Tree representation as nothing will be set in
			target sound control data.

Optional properties:
- qcom,mic_line:	Sound line (register) of main microphone followed by
			its default gain.
- qcom,cam_mic_line:	Sound line (register) of camera microphone followed by
			its default gain.
- qcom,speaker_l_line:	Sound line (register) of left speaker channel followed
			by its default gain.
- qcom,speaker_r_line:	Sound line (register) of right speaker channel followed
			by its default gain. In case the device has only one
			main speaker, this must be equal to the previous
			property.
- qcom,headphone_l_line: Sound line (register) of left headphone channel
			followed by its default gain.
- qcom,headphone_r_line: Sound line (register) of right headphone channel
			followed by its default gain. In case the device has
			only one headphone output, this should be equal to the
			previous property.

			Value range of all lines above: 0 - 0x3FF.
			Value range of all gains above: 0 - 256.

Note that Sound Gain Controller does not check the bounds of values that come
from DT/OF to simplify the code. You must ensure the values are within ranges
above by yourself.

Example:
	qcom,wcd9xxx-snd-ctrl {
		compatible = "qcom,wcd9xxx-snd-ctrl"
		qcom,codec_name = "taiko_codec";
		qcom,mic_line = <0x251 5>;
		qcom,cam_mic_line = <0x249 5>;
		qcom,speaker_l_line = <0x2E7 8>;
		qcom,speaker_r_line = <0x2E7 8>;
		qcom,headphone_l_line = <0x2B7 3>;
		qcom,headphone_r_line = <0x2BF 3>;
	};
